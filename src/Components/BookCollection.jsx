Chapter 1: Introduction to Organic Chemistry

Organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation of carbon-containing compounds. 
This includes hydrocarbons and compounds with any number of other elements, including hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, halogens, phosphorus, silicon, and sulfur.

Key Points:
- Carbon's ability to form four covalent bonds
- Functional groups and their reactivity
- The concept of isomerism

Applications:
- Pharmaceuticals (e.g., aspirin, penicillin)
- Polymers and plastics
- Biofuels

Chapter 2: Alkanes and Alkenes
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons, while alkenes contain double bonds. Their reactivity differs significantly due to the presence of unsaturated carbon bonds.

Chapter 1: Special Relativity

In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed the theory of special relativity, revolutionizing the concepts of space and time.
The two postulates are:
1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.
2. The speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers.

Effects:
- Time dilation: Moving clocks tick slower.
- Length contraction: Moving objects appear shorter in the direction of motion.
- Mass-energy equivalence: E = mcÂ².

Chapter 2: Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics deals with particles at atomic and subatomic scales, where classical physics fails.
Principles include:
- Wave-particle duality
- The uncertainty principle
- Quantized energy levels

Lesson 1: Perfect Tenses

Perfect tenses describe actions completed in relation to another point in time.

Examples:
- Present Perfect: I have finished my homework. (Action completed before now)
- Past Perfect: She had left before the meeting started.
- Future Perfect: By next week, I will have completed the project.

Common Mistakes:
- Mixing up past simple and present perfect
- Forgetting to use 'had' in past perfect

Lesson 2: Conditional Sentences
Conditional sentences describe cause-effect relationships. There are zero, first, second, and third conditionals.

Chapter 1: CSS Grid Basics

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows web developers to create complex, responsive layouts easily.

Core Concepts:
- Grid container and grid items
- Defining columns and rows
- Using 'grid-template-columns' and 'grid-template-rows'
- Gap spacing

Chapter 2: Advanced Animations
CSS animations can bring life to a website.
Properties:
- @keyframes
- animation-delay, animation-duration
- cubic-bezier timing functions

Example:
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}

Chapter 1: Variables and Expressions

A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that represents an unknown value.
Expressions are combinations of variables, numbers, and operations.

Example:
3x + 5 = 11

Solving:
1. Subtract 5 from both sides â†’ 3x = 6
2. Divide both sides by 3 â†’ x = 2

Chapter 2: Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation is in the form axÂ² + bx + c = 0.
Solution methods:
- Factoring
- Quadratic formula: x = [-b Â± âˆš(bÂ² - 4ac)] / 2a

Chapter 1: The Cell

The cell is the basic unit of life.
Types:
- Prokaryotic: No nucleus (e.g., bacteria)
- Eukaryotic: Has a nucleus (e.g., plants, animals)

Components:
- Nucleus
- Mitochondria
- Cell membrane

Chapter 2: Genetics
DNA carries genetic information. Genes determine traits.
Principles:
- Mendelian inheritance
- Dominant vs recessive traits

Lesson 1: Variables and Data Types

JavaScript variables store data values.
Data types include:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Object
- Array

Lesson 2: Functions
Functions group reusable blocks of code.

Example:
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello " + name;
}

- Indus (India)
- Tigris-Euphrates (Mesopotamia)

Key Developments:
- Writing systems
- Agricultural revolution
- Early governments

Chapter 2: The Middle Ages
Feudalism, the rise of kingdoms, and the spread of religion shaped Europe, Asia, and Africa.
